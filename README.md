# Machine Learning Cases

## Status: under construction

It's a study case using machine learning procedures, where I could show some examples in diferente areas and features to solve some basic-complex situations.

### These features are under developing:

* SVM (Support Vector Machine):

    SVM_code_exemplo.py <https://github.com/felipadua3/Machine-Learning-cases/blob/master/SVM_code_exemplo.py> : Used to solve data classification cases

### Technologies used until moment: 

* Phyton

Feel free to contacting me at any time.
